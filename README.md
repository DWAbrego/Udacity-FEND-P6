**Udacity FEND P6 Feed Reader Testing**

**README**


This application will complete Jasmine test suites for a web-based RSS feed reader
application.

To run the application, simply start up a browser, and open the index.html file.
The following messages will appear at the bottom of the page, indicating that
all Jasmine testing has passed.

* 8 specs, 0 failures
* Jasmine__TopLevel__Suite
	* RSS Feeds
		* are defined
		* URL is defined
		* name is defined
	* The menu
		* is hidden by default
		* displays when clicked
		* hides when clicked again
	* Initial Entries
		* has at least a single entry
	* New Feed Selection
		* has content changes when new feed loaded

Also the title of the page will end up as 'HTML 5 Rocks.'  This is because
the test suites call the javascript function 'loadfeed()' a few times as part
of the testing process.  This function will load different feeds as if the 
webpage was clicked by a user.
